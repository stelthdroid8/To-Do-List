# To-Do-List

This is a simple to-do list that allows you to add elements to a list.
Each element is able to be crossed off when when completed by clicking on it.
If you wish to delete an item you hover over it and use the icon that will appear.

I populate the list with 3 original tasks at first that are arbitrary which can be deleted or crossed off as you wish. 
To add your own lists you just type into the text box and hit ENTER when compelted. To hide or un-hide the text box, simply click the icon in the top right corner of the list
